Provisional results. This is just a test. It's really slow. The *compressed* html is 73MB for LSOA London and 123MB for MSOA e0 in England. This is with super-generalised shapefiles too, never mind if we want to get things at 20m resolution for LSOAs. Other annoying things:
- kepler.gl is slow
- MSOA England level takes even longer to load
- It is slow
- It flashes between frames sometimes because it uses a rolling window to animate rather than a point for each year
- The year comes up with minutes and seconds and milliseconds and picoseconds
- The file sizes are too big to put on github without lfs

I probably need to find a more practical solution for the full result.

Have a play. Show the legend at the side. I would like to make this full screen too.
