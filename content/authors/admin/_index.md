I am currently studying for a PhD in the [Global Environmental Health](http://globalenvhealth.org) group at the [School of Public Health, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health) under the supervision of [Majid Ezzati](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/majid.ezzati), [James Bennett](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/umahx99), [Seth Flaxman](http://sethrf.com/) and [Mireille Toledano](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.toledano).

As part of the [Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities](http://equitablehealthycities.org) collaboration, my research looks at small-area trends in mortality in London and England using both Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models. I am interested in how environmental and economic deprivation impact different subgroups of the population.

I previously read theoretical physics, also at Imperial College, writing my thesis on the dynamics of hurricanes.
